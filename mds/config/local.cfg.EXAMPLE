# EXAMPLE "local.cfg" for MDS.
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the MDS *.cfg files. This includes overriding
# settings in any of these files:
#    * [mds]/config/mds.cfg
#    * Or any configuration file that is included in 'mds.cfg'
#     (See "include = [filepath]" settings near the end of mds.cfg.
#      By default, it includes all [mds]/config/modules/*.cfg files)
#
# By default, this EXAMPLE file includes a number of commonly overridden configurations.
# * ADD configurations by simply copying them into this file from any existing *.cfg file.
# * REMOVE configurations by simply commenting them out or deleting them below.
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "mds.home" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "mds.home" in the mds.cfg file.
# Similarly, including "oai.solr.url" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "oai.solr.url" in the modules/oai.cfg file.

##########################
# SERVER CONFIGURATION   #
##########################

# MDS installation directory.
# This is the location where you want to install MDS.
# Windows note: Please remember to use forward slashes for all paths (e.g. C:/mds)
mds.home=/mds

# URL of MDS backend ('server' webapp). Include port number etc.
# This is where REST API and all enabled server modules (OAI-PMH, SWORD, SWORDv2, RDF, etc) will respond
mds.server.url = http://localhost:8080/server

# URL of MDS frontend (Angular UI). Include port number etc
# This is used by the backend to provide links in emails, RSS feeds, Sitemaps, etc.
mds.ui.url = http://localhost:3000

# Name of the site
mds.name = MDSPlus

# assetstore.dir, look at DSPACE/config/spring/api/bitstore.xml for more options
# default is ${mds.home}/assetstore, uncomment and modify if you need to use a different path
#assetstore.dir = ${mds.home}/assetstore

# Default language for metadata values
#default.language = en_US

# Solr server/webapp.
# MDS uses Solr for all search/browse capability (and for usage statistics).
# Since MDS 7, SOLR must be installed as a stand-alone service
#solr.server = http://localhost:8983/solr

##########################
# DATABASE CONFIGURATION #
##########################
# MDS only supports two database types: PostgreSQL or Oracle

# URL for connecting to database
#    * Postgres template: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mds
#    * Oracle template: jdbc:oracle:thin:@//localhost:1521/xe
db.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mds

# JDBC Driver
#    * For Postgres: org.postgresql.Driver
#    * For Oracle:   oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database Dialect (for Hibernate)
#    * For Postgres: com.mds.storage.rdbms.hibernate.postgres.MDSPostgreSQL82Dialect
#    * For Oracle:   org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect
db.dialect = com.mds.storage.rdbms.hibernate.postgres.MDSPostgreSQL82Dialect

# Database username and password
db.username = mds
db.password = mds

# Database Schema name
#    * For Postgres, this is often "public" (default schema)
#    * For Oracle, schema is equivalent to the username of your database account,
#      so this may be set to ${db.username} in most scenarios.
db.schema = public

## Connection pool parameters

# Maximum number of DB connections in pool (default = 30)
#db.maxconnections = 30

# Maximum time to wait before giving up if all connections in pool are busy (milliseconds)
# (default = 5000ms or 5 seconds)
#db.maxwait = 5000

# Maximum number of idle connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
# (default = 10)
#db.maxidle = 10


#######################
# EMAIL CONFIGURATION #
#######################

# SMTP mail server (allows MDS to send email notifications)
#mail.server = smtp.example.com

# SMTP mail server authentication username and password (if required)
#mail.server.username = myusername
#mail.server.password = mypassword

# SMTP mail server alternate port (defaults to 25)
#mail.server.port = 25

# From address for mail
# All mail from the MDS site will use this 'from' address
#mail.from.address = mds-noreply@mmdsplus.com

# When feedback is submitted via the Feedback form, it is sent to this address
# Currently limited to one recipient!
#feedback.recipient = mds-help@mmdsplus.com

# General site administration (Webmaster) e-mail
#mail.admin = mds-help@mmdsplus.com

# Recipient for server errors and alerts (defaults to mail.admin)
#alert.recipient = ${mail.admin}

# Recipient for new user registration emails (defaults to unspecified)
#registration.notify =

#######################
# PROXY CONFIGURATION #
#######################
# uncomment and specify both properties if proxy server required
# proxy server for external http requests - use regular hostname without port number
#http.proxy.host =

# port number of proxy server
#http.proxy.port =

##########################
# AUTHENTICATION METHODS #
##########################
# EXAMPLE OVERRIDE:
# Override the default authentication method(s) defined in authentication.cfg
# by defining your own custom ordered list in this local.cfg.
#
# By default, all of these methods are commented out and MDS will use the
# settings from authentication.cfg. But you may uncomment whichever plugins you
# need in order to change the default settings (or reorder them below).
#
# You may also copy default settings from the corresponding authentication-*.cfg
# configuration file and override them in this local.cfg.

# IP-based authentication/authorization. See authentication-ip.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.com.mds.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = com.mds.authenticate.IPAuthentication

# LDAP authentication/authorization. See authentication-ldap.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.com.mds.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = com.mds.authenticate.LDAPAuthentication

# Shibboleth authentication/authorization. See authentication-shibboleth.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.com.mds.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = com.mds.authenticate.ShibAuthentication

# X.509 certificate authentication. See authentication-x509.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.com.mds.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = com.mds.authenticate.X509Authentication

# Authentication by Password (encrypted in MDS's database). See authentication-password.cfg for default configuration.
# Enabled by default in authentication.cfg
#plugin.sequence.com.mds.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = com.mds.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication
