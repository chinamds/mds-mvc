Most common image types, such as JPG, GIF, BMP, TIF, and PNG are accepted.</p><p>Relative paths are relative to the root of the web application. The directory-separating character can be either a forward or backward slash, and, for relative paths, the initial slash is optional.</p><p>Leave this setting blank if no image watermark is desired.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul class='mds_addleftmargin5'><li>/images/mywatermark.jpg</li><li>images/mywatermark.gif</li><li>\images\mywatermark.bmp</li><li>images\mywatermark.tif</li><li>C:\images\mywatermark.png</li></ul>
cfg.watermarkImagePath_Hdr=Watermark image path
cfg.watermarkImageWidthPercent_Bdy=<p>Specifies the percent of the overall width of the recipient image that should be covered with the watermark image. The size of the image is automatically scaled to achieve the desired width. Valid values are 0 - 100.</p><p>For example, a value of 50 means the watermark image is 50% as wide as the recipient image.</p><p>A value of 0 turns off this feature and causes the image to be rendered at its actual size.</p>
cfg.watermarkImageWidthPercent_Hdr=Watermark image width (%)
cfg.watermarkTextColor_Bdy=<p>The color of the watermark text. It can be specified as hex (e.g. #336699), RGB (e.g. 127,55,95), or one of the System.Color.KnownColor enum values (e.g. Maroon).</p>
cfg.watermarkTextColor_Hdr=Watermark font color

cfg.watermarkTextLocation_Bdy=<p>Specifies the location for the watermark text on the recipient image.</p>
cfg.watermarkTextLocation_Hdr=Watermark text location
cfg.watermarkTextOpacityPercent_Bdy=<p>The opacity of the watermark text. This is a value from 0 to 100, with 0 being invisible and 100 being solid, with no transparency.</p>
cfg.watermarkTextOpacityPercent_Hdr=Watermark text opacity
cfg.watermarkTextWidthPercent_Bdy=<p>Specifies the percent of the overall width of the recipient image that should be covered with the watermark text. The size of the text is automatically scaled up or down to achieve the desired width. Valid values are 0 - 100.</p><p>This setting overrides the watermark font size setting. To disable this setting so that the watermark font size is enabled, set this value to zero.</p><p>For example, a value of 50 means the text is 50% as wide as the recipient image.</p><p>The text is never rendered in a font smaller than 4 pixels, so in cases of long text it may stretch wider than the percentage specified in this setting.</p>
cfg.watermarkTextWidthPercent_Hdr=Watermark text width (%)

admin.manageRoles.HideWatermark_Hdr=Do not show watermark permission
admin.manageRoles.Overview_Bdy=<p>Security in MDS System consists of creating roles with the desired permissions applied to specific albums. Users are then assigned to one or more of these roles.</p><p>The default System Administrator role provides administrative privileges to all galleries. You can create additional roles with specific permissions that target individual albums.</p><p>When a role is applied to an album, it is automatically applied to all child albums. When an album is added, moved, or copied to a new location, it inherits any role permissions from the containing album.</p><p>MDS System will give a user permission to perform an activity if any of the user's roles contain the requested permission, even if the others do not. For example, say a user belongs to three roles. Two of the roles do not have Delete album permission but the third one does. In this case, the user is given permission to delete the album that is specified in the role with the Delete album permission.</p>
admin.manageRoles.Overview_Hdr=Overview of roles
admin.manageRoles.Synchronize_Bdy=<p>This permission provides the ability to synchronize the content object files on the web server's hard drive with the records in the data store.</p><p>Note: If a user has the ability to edit the content objects directory outside the security boundary of MDS System (such as using a utility like Windows Explorer), and the user also has Synchronize permission here, he or she effectively has the ability to add and delete albums and content objects, even if those permissions are not included in a user's role.</p>
admin.manageRoles.Synchronize_Hdr=Synchronize permission
admin.manageRoles.ViewHiResImage_Bdy=<p>This permission provides read only access to the original version of content files, if they exist.</p><p>For example, when a user uploads a large photo, a web-optimized version is created. Access to the web-optimized version is controlled through the View albums/objects permission, and access to the high-resolution original is controlled through this permission.</p><p>Similarly, when the Binary Pack is used to create web-optimized versions of video and audio files, the View albums/objects permission controls access to the web-optimized version, and the original video is protected by this permission.</p><p>Note that when web-optimized versions do not exist (e.g. for documents, small images, or for video and audio when the Binary Pack is not installed), this permission is ignored.</p>
admin.manageRoles.ViewHiResImage_Hdr=View original content source permission
admin.manageRoles.ViewObject_Bdy=<p>This permission provides a read only view of photos, videos, and other content objects. Note that when web-optimized versions of content objects exist, this permission applies to them and not the original content file. Use the permission View original content source to control access to the original file.</p>
admin.manageRoles.ViewObject_Hdr=View objects permission
admin.manageUsers.Overview_Bdy=<p>User accounts are used to control access to albums and gallery management functions. By default, MDS System allows anonymous browsing of all albums but requires that users log in to create albums, add content objects, and perform administrative tasks.</p><p>Note: You can disable anonymous browsing on the User Settings page.</p><p>Users are assigned to one or more roles. Use the manage roles page to configure the roles with the desired permission. Then use this page to assign each user to the appropriate role(s).</p><p>A user has permission to perform an activity if any of the user's roles contain the requested permission, even if the others do not. For example, say a user belongs to three roles. Two of the roles do not have Delete album permission but the third one does.

For example, you may want to disable this option to restrict access to the high resolution version of your images. When unchecked, users can access the original file only by logging in with a valid account, and that account must belong to a role having View original content source permission.</p><p>This setting is ignored when anonymous browsing is disabled and when downloading of content files is disabled.</p>
cfg.allowAnonMoDownload_Hdr=Allow anonymous access to original content file
cfg.extractMetadata_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether MDS System extracts metadata from files. When enabled, metadata stored in image files such as title, camera model, etc, are extracted when they are uploaded by a user or added through the synchronization process. Users can view this metadata by clicking the toolbar button above the content object.</p><p>Disable this option when metadata does not add value to your gallery, as this will improve performance.</p><p>The following formats are supported: EXIF, XMP, tEXt, IFD,  and IPTC.</p><p>Metadata such as bit rate, duration, and format can also be extracted from video and audio files. This requires that FFmpeg be installed and the application be running at Full Trust.</p><p>The FFmpeg utility is included in the free MDS System Binary Pack, available for download from the website.</p>
cfg.extractMetadata_Hdr=Extract metadata from files
cfg.contentObjectPathIsReadOnly_Bdy=<p>MDS System helps you share and manage your content collection over the web. In some cases you may not want to allow it to make any changes to your content files. In other words, you want MDS System to expose a read-only view of your collection.</p><p>When MDS System is in read-only mode, users cannot create albums or upload files, nor can they move, copy or delete albums and content objects. That is, they cannot perform any action that modifies the original content files. However, users <em>can</em> synchronize, download, sort, edit titles, captions and tags, and administrators can change settings in the Site admin area, including managing users and roles.</p><p>There are several requirements that must be met before a gallery can be made read-only:</p><ul class='mds_addleftmargin5'><li>User albums must be disabled</li><li>The directory for the thumbnail and compressed images must be different than the original content objects directory</li><li>The option <em>Synchronize directory names with album titles</em> must be disabled</li></ul><p>When a gallery is read-only, the only way to add or remove content objects is by manually updating the content objects directory with a tool like Windows Explorer and then running the synchronize function.</p><p>If this setting is enabled, it is recommended to configure the IIS application pool identity to have read-only access to the content objects directory as an additional safeguard. This helps guarantee that the web application cannot manipulate the content files.</p>
cfg.contentObjectPathIsReadOnly_Hdr=Content files are read-only
# -- 
cfg.optimizedFileNamePrefix_Bdy=<p>The string that is prepended to the optimized file name for images. This setting is only used for image content objects where a compressed image file is created.</p><p>For example, if an image named puppy.jpg is added, and this setting is zOpt_, the optimized image will be named zOpt_puppy.jpg.</p><p> NOTE: Any file named zOpt_puppy.jpg that already exists will be overwritten, so it is important to choose a value that, when prepended to content object file names, will not conflict with existing content objects.</p><p>NOTE: After changing this value, perform a synchronization so that new optimized images are created with the new name and the old ones are deleted.</p>
cfg.optimizedFileNamePrefix_Hdr=Compressed file name prefix
# -- 
cfg.sendEmailUsingSsl_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether e-mail functionality uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the connection. Select this option if your e-mail provider requires SSL.</p>
cfg.sendEmailUsingSsl_Hdr=Send e-mail using SSL
# -- 
cfg.synchAlbumTitleAndDirectoryName_Bdy=<p>Indicates whether to update the directory name corresponding to an album when the album's title is changed. When true, modifying the title of an album causes the directory name to change to the same value. You may want to disable this if you have a directory structure that you do not want MDS System to alter.</p><p>Note that even if this setting is disabled, directories will still be moved or copied when the user moves or copies an album. Also, MDS System always modifies the directory name when it is necessary to make it unique within a parent directory. For example, this may happen if you give two sibling albums the same title or you move/copy an album into a directory containing another album with the same name.</p><p>This setting must be disabled when the gallery is configured to be read-only.</p>
cfg.synchAlbumTitleAndDirectoryName_Hdr=Synchronize directory names with album titles
# -- 
cfg.thumbnailFileNamePrefix_Bdy=<p>The string that is prepended to the thumbnail file name for each content object.</p><p>For example, if an image named puppy.jpg is added, and this setting is zThumb_, the thumbnail image will be named zThumb_puppy.jpg.</p><p>NOTE: Any file named zThumb_puppy.jpg that already exists will be overwritten, so it is important to choose a value that, when prepended to content object file names, will not conflict with existing content objects.</p><p>NOTE: After changing this value, perform a synchronization so that new thumbnails are created with the new name and the old ones are deleted.</p>
cfg.thumbnailFileNamePrefix_Hdr=Thumbnail file name prefix
# -- 
cfg.thumbnailImageJpegQuality_Bdy=<p>The quality level that thumbnail JPG images are created with. Valid values are 1 - 100, with 1 being the worst quality (smallest file size) and 100 being the best quality (largest file size).</p>

cfg.enableMoDownload_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether MDS System lets a user download the file associated with a content object.</p><p>Note that disabling this setting is not 100% effective in preventing a user from downloading a content object, since a user already has access if he or she can view it in the browser. The only effective method for ensuring users cannot download your content files is to use DRM protection, which is a feature that MDS System does not provide.</p>
cfg.enableMoDownload_Hdr=Allow downloading albums and content files
# -- 
cfg.enableMoZipDownload_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether users can download albums and content files in a ZIP archive.

This option is system wide and cannot be applied on a per-user or per-album basis.</p>
cfg.enableMoZipDownload_Hdr=Allow downloading albums and content files in ZIP archive
cfg.enableSlideShow_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether slide show functionality is enabled. When enabled, a start/pause slideshow button is displayed in the toolbar that appears above a content object.</p><p> The length of time each image is shown before automatically moving to the next one is controlled by the slideshow interval setting.</p><p>Note that only images are shown during a slide show; other objects such as videos, audio files, and documents are skipped.</p><p>This setting can be overridden on the Gallery Control Settings page.</p>
cfg.enableSlideShow_Hdr=Enable slide show
# -- 
cfg.extractMetadataUsingWpf_Bdy=<p>When enabled and the application is running in full trust, metadata is extracted from image files using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) classes available in .NET Framework 3.0 and higher. The WPF classes allow additional metadata to be extracted, such as title, keywords, GPS coordinates, and IPTC data.</p><p>Since the WPF classes are only available when running in full trust, this option has no effect in reduced trust installations.</p>

cfg.enabledPaging_Bdy=<p>Indicates whether to limit the number of content objects to display at a time. When paging is enabled and an album has a large number of items, paging controls appear to assist the user in navigating to them. When disabled, all objects are displayed in an album.</p>

cfg.sortByMetaName_Bdy=<p>Specifies the property and direction by which new albums are sorted.</p><p>Only properties that are visible for albums or content objects on the Metadata page are shown in this list. If necessary, enable the property first on the Metadata page and then rebuild the item to create data that can be sorted on. In other words, if you can't see the property in the right pane when viewing the object, you can't sort on it.</p><p>Remember that many metadata properties won't be present in a content file - VideoFormat won't exist in images, for example. As a result, enabling and rebuilding a particular property is no guarantee of having data for that item. Content items without any data for the sort property will be grouped together but the sort order among themselves is undefined.</p><p>NOTE: To help keep the UI simple, the default album UI template lets users sort by only a few fields. If you want to let users sort by additional fields such as those shown here, edit the album template to include the desired items.</p>

admin.gallerySettings.CurrentGallery_Info_Bdy=<p>Here you can change the gallery the current instance of MDS System points to.</p><p>A gallery has these charecteristics:</p><ul class='mds_addleftmargin5'><li>Contains a collection of albums and content objects that are stored at or below a particular file path</li><li>Has a distinct set of settings, such as watermark, image size, user settings, etc.</li><li>Can be managed by a gallery or site administrator</li></ul> <p>By default, each web application has one gallery. This is sufficient for many users, but there are situations where it can be useful to have more than one gallery:</p><ul class='mds_addleftmargin5'><li>You want to have one gallery for staging and another for production.</li><li>You have departments in your company that should each have their own gallery.</li><li>You have content files in multiple locations you want to expose, such as D:\Pictures and D:\Video.</li><li>You want to set up a gallery for each member of your family.</li><li>You want some images to be 640x480 and others to be smaller (or larger).</li><li>You require different watermarks to be applied to different sets of images. </li><li>You want to provide a user with different gallery-wide permissions. For example, perhaps you want user Bob to be a gallery administrator for one set of objects but have edit-only permission for another set. </li><li>You want to allow some users to upload any file type of any size, but others should only be able to upload .JPEG files that are less than 5 MB.</li></ul><p>Note that if all you want to do is hide albums from certain users, you can use roles and an album's privacy setting rather than creating a new gallery.</p><p class='mds_bold'>Viewing multiple galleries</p><p>Each instance of the MDS System control is associated with a single gallery. To view multiple galleries, you must create additional web pages and point those instances of MDS System to the new gallery. One easy way to do this is to copy the web page containing this control, give it a new name, then load the page in a web browser, navigate to the Gallery Manager and point it to the new gallery.</p>
admin.gallerySettings.CurrentGallery_Info_Hdr=Current gallery
admin.gallerySettings.ManageGalleries_Info_Bdy=<p>Add, edit or delete galleries for the current web application. The table displays only those galleries where the currently logged on user is a gallery administrator.</p><p>You can view the contents of the current gallery with the View link. To view other galleries, first switch to that gallery in the Current Gallery section.</p><p>Clicking the Edit link allows you to change the name of the gallery. To modify other settings, such as the content files path, use the appropriate administration page.</p>Deleting a gallery will delete all albums, content objects, and other records associated with the gallery. As a safety precaution, the content files are NOT deleted - only the records in the database are deleted. You may delete the content files manually using a tool like Windows Explorer.<p></p>The Create gallery link creates a new gallery, including a default set of gallery settings. After creating a gallery, one of the first things you should do is update the content files path on the Content Objects - General page.
admin.gallerySettings.ManageGalleries_Info_Hdr=Manage galleries
cfg.gcs.AllowAnonBrowsing_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether users can browse the gallery without logging in. When unchecked, users must log in with a valid account to view content objects.</p><p>Remember that this setting applies only to the instance of MDS System on this web page. If an administrator created other web pages with a gallery, this setting does not apply to them.</p>
cfg.gcs.AllowAnonBrowsing_Hdr=Allow anonymous browsing
cfg.gcs.AllowUrlOverride_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether an album or content object specified in the URL can override the default gallery object specified above. Since this is the means by which most album and content object navigation occurs in MDS System, disabling this option prevents the user from viewing any album or content object other than the one specified as the default gallery object.</p><p>When unchecked, hyperlinks are not rendered on thumbnail images or the album breadcrumb menu.</p><p>Another way to prevent users from viewing albums or content objects is to set an album as private (for anonymous users) or use role permissions (for logged on users).</p><p>NOTE: This setting DOES NOT affect the ability of a user to click the Next / Previous buttons that appear above a single content object. To disable this type of navigation, disable the option below called Show content object navigation buttons.</p>
cfg.gcs.AllowUrlOverride_Hdr=Allow URL navigation
cfg.gcs.AutoPlaySlideshow_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether a slide show of images automatically starts playing when the page loads.</p><p>An album must contain at least one image for a slide show to run.</p>
cfg.gcs.AutoPlaySlideshow_Hdr=Auto-start slide show
cfg.gcs.DefaultGalleryObject_Bdy=<p>Specifies which gallery object to display when an object is not specifically requested. That is, loading the web page without any query string parameters will cause the gallery object specified here to be displayed.</p><p>You can select the current gallery, which will show the root level album, or you can choose a specific album or content object.</p><p>Users are never shown objects they do not have permission to view. When the default gallery object is set to the current gallery, the user is shown the highest album he or she has permission to view. If an album or content object option is specified and the user does not have permission to view it, a message appears telling the user they have insufficient permission.</p><p>NOTE: When the Allow URL navigation option is enabled, users can navigate to other albums and content objects by specifying an album or content object ID in the query string. You may want to disable that option to prevent users from viewing other albums or content objects.</p>
cfg.gcs.DefaultGalleryObject_Hdr=Default Gallery Object

cfg.gcs.OverrideSettings_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether to override the gallery settings for this instance of the MDS System control on the current web page.</p><p>When disabled, the behavior of the gallery is controlled by settings on the other administration pages. When enabled, those settings are overridden by the specific values set here.</p>
cfg.gcs.OverrideSettings_Hdr=Override default settings
cfg.gcs.Overview_Bdy=<p>By default, the settings for this instance of the MDS System control on the current web page are inherited from the gallery-level settings specified on the other pages in the Site admin area. Since an administrator can display a gallery on more than one page, it is sometimes useful to be able to specify settings at the control level rather than the gallery level.</p><p>For example, an administrator might place an instance of MDS System on the home page and use the settings here to display a slide show of a particular album. A separate web page might contain the user control with default settings to allow for easy management.</p><p>IMPORTANT: Remember that the settings on this page override the settings on other pages. It is also important to understand that the settings affect this control instance, regardless of which gallery is being displayed. If you switch to another gallery on the Gallery Manager page, these settings will remain the same while the other pages will reflect the settings for the new gallery. (One exception to this rule is that if an album or content object is specified as the default gallery object, it is cleared after switching galleries, since the previous value is no longer valid.)</p>
cfg.gcs.Overview_Hdr=About Gallery Control Settings
cfg.gcs.ShowActionMenu_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether to show the Actions menu for logged on users.</p><p>NOTE: Regardless of this setting, the Actions menu is always HIDDEN for anonymous users and for logged-on users who do not have permission to carry out any task. The Actions menu is always VISIBLE for gallery and site administrators, even when this setting is disabled (this helps you get back to the admin area to adjust settings).</p>

cfg.gcs.ShowAlbumBreadcrumb_Hdr=Show album breadcrumb menu

cfg.gcs.ShowAlbumTreeViewForContentObject_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether to render the left pane when a single content object is being displayed. By default the left pane contains a treeview of albums, but this can be modified by editing the left pane template.</p>
cfg.gcs.ShowAlbumTreeViewForContentObject_Hdr=Show album treeview (content objects)
cfg.gcs.ShowCopyButton_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether the copy content object button is visible above a content object.

You may want to disable this feature when the audience is primarily anonymous web users without user accounts.</p><p>Administrators can always log in by navigating directly to the login page (use the query string g=login; ex: default.aspx?g=login).</p>
cfg.gcs.ShowLogin_Hdr=Show user account controls
cfg.gcs.ShowContentObjectIndexPosition_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether to display the relative position of a content object within an album (example: (3 of 24)). This text is shown only when a single content object is being displayed.</p>
cfg.gcs.ShowContentObjectIndexPosition_Hdr=Show content object index position
cfg.gcs.ShowContentObjectNavigation_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether the next and previous buttons are rendered for individual content objects. Disabling this option also disables the ability to navigate using the left and right arrow keys.</p>

cfg.gcs.ShowMoveButton_Hdr=Transfer content object button
cfg.gcs.ShowPermalinkButton_Bdy=<p>Specifies whether MDS System displays a button for getting download links and embed code for a content object.</p><p>The embed code can be pasted into other websites, allowing those websites to display content objects from the gallery.</p><p>This setting has no effect when the content object toolbar is hidden.</p>
cfg.gcs.ShowPermalinkButton_Hdr=Links/embed code button

admin.vidAudOther.EncoderSettings_Overview_Bdy=<p>You can create web-friendly versions of video and audio files when they are added to the gallery or during synchronization.</p><p>The settings in this section are used to match video and audio files based on the file extension, and then create an encoded version based on the provided arguments. The order is important, as the gallery applies the first match it finds. That means you want the All video and All audio selectors last. If an encoding fails, the next matching encoding is tried.</p><p>The arguments you specify are passed to FFmpeg and can contain any valid FFmpeg options. The following replacement tokens are supported: {SourceFilePath}, {DestinationFilePath}, {Width} (an integer without units), {Height} (an integer without units), {AspectRatio} (the aspect ratio of a video, such as 1.33 or 1.78), {BinPath} (full path to app's bin directory), and {GalleryResourcesPath} (full path to MDS's resources directory).</p><p>The {Width} and {Height} parameters apply to videos and are replaced by the width and height of the original video file. If these values cannot be determined, the default width and height values specified in the General section above are used.</p><p>To tell the encoder to skip a particular file type, enter an empty set of FFmpeg arguments.</p><p>The default encoder settings for video attempt to create a web-optimized MP4 H.264 version. If that fails, a Flash Video (FLV) version is attempted. Audio files are encoded to M4A. MP3, M4A, and FLV files are not encoded since they are already web-friendly.</p><p>To force the encoder to run against existing content objects, perform a synchronization. Use the <em>Rebuild optimized versions</em> option to overwrite any existing encoded version.</p><p>The encoder requires the application to be running at full trust and the FFmpeg.exe utility exist in the application's bin directory. FFmpeg can be found at <a href='http://www.ffmpeg.org'>ffmpeg.org</a> or, for your convenience, in the <a href='http://www.mmdsplus.com'>MDS System Binary Pack</a>.</p>

admin.uiTemplate.Overview_Bdy=<p>The gallery is rendered from jsRender templates defined on this page.

To reduce the complexity of JavaScript stored in the templates and to improve performance, you'll notice the script in these templates delegate their actions to custom jQuery plug-ins defined in a minified script file. If you need to change these plug-ins, do so in the debug version of the script (gallery.js or lib.js) and re-minify. See the Admin Guide for full documentation for the client API and tips for modifying the templates.</p><p>It is recommended that you do not edit the default template. Instead, make a copy and configure that one instead of the default template. This way you can always revert back to the original if desired.</p><p>You can create several templates, each targeted to specific albums. For example, you might have an album of PDF files that you want rendered as a list view instead of a thumbnail.</p><p>WARNING: Editing the layout is for advanced users with HTML and JavaScript skills. Remember that much of the UI layout and behavior can be controlled by changing settings on the other pages in the site admin area. Whenever possible, change a setting there before resorting to a UI template change. This can help preserve your preferences during upgrades because most settings are carried forward into new versions, while it is likely that templates will change.</p>

That file contains the UI darkness theme and was created with a scope of .mds_ns to minimize its impact on non-gallery areas of a web application when it is integrated into an existing site. To preserve the ability to easily upgrade to future versions of jQuery UI, it is recommended you do not edit this file. Instead, override those styles by editing the CSS file shown on this page.</p>

This makes it easier to revert to the original configuration if desired.
